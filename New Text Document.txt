You know me the fighting freak Knuckles,
And we're at Pumpkin Hill
You ready?
I ain't gonna let it get to me, I'm just gonna creep,
Down in Pumpkin Hill I gotz to find my lost piece.
I know that it's here, I can sense it in my feet,
The great Emerald's power allows me to feel.
I can't see a thing but it's around somewhere,
I'm gonna hold my head 'cause I have no fear.
This probably seems crazy, crazy, a graveyard theory,
A ghost tried to approach me, and got leary.
Asked him a question and he vanished in a second,
I walkin' through valley, cryin' pumpkins in the alley.
Didn't seem happy but they sure trying to get me,
Had to back 'em up with the fist metal crackle.
I'm hearing someone saying you a chicken, don't be scared!
It had to be the wind, 'cause nobody wasn't there.
I searched and I searched as I climbed up the wall,
And then I started to fly, I went in deeper!
Let it get to me? I'm just gonna creep,
Down in Pumpkin Hill I gotz to find my lost piece.
I know that it's here, I sense it in my feet,
The great Emerald's power allows me to feel.
I can't see a thing but it's around somewhere,
I gotta hold my head, I have no fear.
It probably seems crazy, crazy, a graveyard theory,
A ghost tried to approach me, he got leary.
(This is Knuckles, who fears no one...
Bein' real bad when it comes to my name kid)
(it's spooky up in the hill...
it's crazy in here...

Nobody scares me!...
Whoever wanna bring it...
I don't care, we can do this!...
Hey, come step up to the plate and meet your match...
It ain't no thang...)
